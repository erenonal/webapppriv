This project performs sentiment analysis on product reviews, using **Logitech G502 mouse** reviews as an example. It scrapes reviews from Amazon using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `textblob`, and `google_translate_new`. The program collects data such as product title, rating, and review body, then saves the reviews to an Excel or CSV file. After translating the reviews to English, it analyzes their sentiment using `textblob`, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. Finally, the sentiment distribution is visualized.
