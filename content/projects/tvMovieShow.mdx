This project is a responsive movie discovery platform built with Vue 3 and Axios, designed to fetch and display movie content from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. As a Single Page Application (SPA), it provides seamless navigation using Vue Router, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
With a mobile-first approach, the design is optimized for various screen sizes. The interface is styled using Vanilla CSS, with colors and design elements carefully extracted from Figma to maintain a visually cohesive and modern appearance.
To ensure a dynamic and efficient browsing experience, the project incorporates error handling mechanisms, allowing the system to gracefully manage API failures. Pagination is implemented to facilitate easy navigation through large datasets, ensuring smooth content exploration. Additionally, users can access detailed movie pages, retrieving in-depth information dynamically for each selection.
This platform combines functionality, responsiveness, and an intuitive UI, making it an effective solution for discovering and exploring movies in an engaging and efficient way.
