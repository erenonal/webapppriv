This website provides real-time statistics, recommendations, and full store management capabilities, allowing users to perform CRUD operations, receive notifications, and optimize their sales strategies.

Initially, the project was built using Vue 2, Vuetify, Vuex Store, and Highcharts. However, as the technology stack evolved, it was upgraded to Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia for better performance and maintainability. The transition from Vue 2 to Vue 3 was necessary to refactor the codebase, which had become complex and difficult to manage in its earlier form. Given the project's size, the migration was carried out page by page, requiring the creation of two separate codebases running in parallel. To ensure a smooth transition and prevent security vulnerabilities, special attention was given to managing authorization tokens, avoiding conflicts between the two systems.

During this process, I personally developed over five live pages, enabling store owners to make real-time and future campaign-based updates to their products, such as percentage-based discounts and price adjustments. These pages also allowed users to list and tag their products, perform ASIN- and SKU-based operations, and ultimately increase their revenue through data-driven insights.

Beyond development, I took on the leadership of the frontend team, managing collaboration with backend, deployment, and project management teams to ensure seamless execution across all aspects of the project.
