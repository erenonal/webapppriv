This project is a system that manages vehicle rentals. Users can rent bikes or cars on an hourly or daily basis, with set prices for each. Discounts can be applied to vehicles, and when vehicles are returned, an invoice with the rental details is provided. The system manages the stock and pricing of vehicles while preventing users from making incorrect entries and guiding them correctly.
